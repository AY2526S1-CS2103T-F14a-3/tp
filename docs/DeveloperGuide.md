### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F14a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/edutrack/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F14a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/edutrack/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F14a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/edutrack/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F14a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/edutrack/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F14a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F14a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/edutrack/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F14a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/edutrack/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data, which includes: 
  * All `Person` objects contained within a `UniquePersonList`.
  * All `Group` objects contained within a `UniqueGroupList`. 
  * All `Tag` objects contained within a `UniqueTagList`.

* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search or filter command) as a separate `FilteredList<Person>`, exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`.  
  This allows the UI to automatically update whenever the data in the list changes.

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F14a-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/edutrack/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `edutrack.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level

Our project, EduTrack, extends the AB3 baseline with significantly increased complexity. While AB3 manages a single entity type `Person`, EduTrack introduces **three entity types**: `Person`, `Group`, and `Tag`. This required substantial effort in designing relationships, maintaining data consistency, and ensuring proper cascading operations.

The difficulty was further amplified by the need to:
- Implement a centralized management system for Groups and Tags (similar to how AB3 manages Persons)
- Design and implement 10+ new commands for group and tag operations
- Ensure bidirectional relationships between entities remain consistent
- Handle complex cascading deletions (e.g., deleting a group must remove it from all assigned persons)

### Challenges Faced

**1. Entity Relationship Management**

The most significant challenge was managing the relationships between `Person`, `Group`, and `Tag` entities. Unlike AB3's simple list of persons, our system required:
- `UniqueGroupList` and `UniqueTagList` to centrally manage groups and tags
- Ensuring that persons can only be assigned to existing groups/tags
- Implementing cascading updates when groups/tags are deleted

**2. Storage Complexity**

Extending the JSON storage to handle three entity types while maintaining referential integrity was challenging. We had to:
- Design JSON schemas for groups and tags
- Implement proper serialization/deserialization for the new entities
- Add validation to ensure stored data maintains consistency (e.g., persons don't reference non-existent groups)
- Handle backward compatibility and corrupted data scenarios

**3. UI Enhancements**

We enhanced the UI to display both groups and tags for each person, which required:
- Modifying the `PersonCard` UI component to display multiple entity types
- Implementing proper wrapping behavior for tags and groups to prevent overflow
- Adding visual distinction between tags and groups (different colors)
- Ensuring the UI updates correctly when groups/tags are added or removed

**4. Command Parser Architecture**

Adding 10+ new commands required careful design of the parser architecture:
- Implemented parsers for all group operations (`group/create`, `group/delete`, `group/assign`, `group/unassign`, `group/list`)
- Implemented parsers for all tag operations (`tag/create`, `tag/delete`, `tag/assign`, `tag/unassign`, `tag/list`)
- Added `findtag` command with specialized predicate for tag-based filtering
- Ensured consistent error handling and validation across all new commands

### Effort Required

The project required approximately **3-4 times** the effort of AB3:

**Code Contribution:**
- Added 20+ new classes for commands, parsers, and predicates
- Modified 15+ existing classes to support the new entity types
- Implemented comprehensive test coverage with 350+ test cases
- Total: ~4000+ lines of functional code and ~3000+ lines of test code

**Time Investment:**
- Design and planning: ~10 hours (entity relationships, storage design, command structure)
- Implementation: ~70 hours (commands, storage, model changes, UI updates)
- Testing: ~20 hours (unit tests, integration tests, manual testing)
- Documentation: ~20 hours (User Guide, Developer Guide, diagrams)
- Total: ~120 hours of development effort

### Achievements

Despite the challenges, we successfully delivered a robust tutor management system with the following achievements:

1. **Centralized Entity Management**: Implemented a scalable architecture where groups and tags are managed centrally, preventing duplication and inconsistencies.

2. **Data Integrity**: Implemented cascading operations ensuring that deleting a group/tag automatically removes it from all assigned persons, maintaining referential integrity.

3. **Enhanced Search Capabilities**: Users can find persons by groups and tags, providing powerful filtering options.

4. **Robust Testing**: Achieved high test coverage with comprehensive unit and integration tests, ensuring reliability.

5. **User-Friendly UI**: Enhanced the UI to clearly display multiple entity types with visual distinction and proper overflow handling.

### Reuse and Adaptation

While we built most features from scratch, we reused and adapted several components from AB3:

1. **Storage Framework (~10% effort saved)**: We reused AB3's `JsonSerializableAddressBook` architecture and adapted it to handle `Group` and `Tag` entities. Our work is primarily contained in:
   - `JsonAdaptedGroup.java` and `JsonAdaptedTag.java` for serialization
   - `JsonSerializableAddressBook.java` modifications to handle the new entity lists

2. **Command Architecture (~5% effort saved)**: We followed AB3's `Command` and `CommandParser` patterns, which provided a solid foundation. However, we still had to implement all the logic for our 10+ new commands.

3. **UI Components (~5% effort saved)**: We extended AB3's `PersonCard` component rather than building from scratch, but significant modifications were needed to display groups and tags with proper styling.

**Total effort saved through reuse: ~20%**

The remaining 80% of effort went into designing the multi-entity architecture, implementing new commands, ensuring data consistency, and building comprehensive test coverage, all of which required substantial original work beyond AB3's scope.
