# EduTrack

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

* This is **an address book and classroom manager for tutors**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Tutors can group students according to their classes.
  * Tutors can keep track of students' performance in each class
* The project serves as a desktop application (called _EduTrack_) used for managing contact details, student groups, attendance records, and demarcate students based on their performance.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* It is named `EduTrack` because it combines education and productivity, allowing tutors to track student attendance, details, and performance efficiently.
